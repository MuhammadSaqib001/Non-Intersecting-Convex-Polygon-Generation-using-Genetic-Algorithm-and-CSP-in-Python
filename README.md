# Non-Intersecting Convex Polygon Generation using Genetic Algorithm and CSP

This project generates non-intersecting convex polygons in n dimensions using a combination of Genetic Algorithm and Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques. The goal is to evolve a population of polygons that adhere to geometric constraints, ensuring non-intersecting, convex shapes.
